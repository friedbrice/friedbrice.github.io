Using log odds and a few innocuous simplifying assumptions, we can quickly estimate the relative odds of two competing claims.

<!--break-->

- **Evidence:**
  An observed matter of fact, the truth of which is not in dispute among the participants, or not in dispute for the sake of discussion.
  The observation of evidence and the desire to infer the cause of the evidence is what motivates the discussion.

- **Claim:**
  An hypothesized matter of fact, the truth of which is in dispute among the participants.
  A claim serves as a potential explaination of what caused the evidence.
  The purpose of the discussion is to determine the relative odds of two or more competing claims.

- **Exclusive:**
  To call a set of claims _exclusive_ is to say that it is impossible that more than one of the claims is true.
  They're mutually contradictory.

- **Exhaustive:**
  To call a set of claims _exhaustive_ is to say that it is impossible that fewer than one of the claims is true.
  Collectively, they include every possibility.
