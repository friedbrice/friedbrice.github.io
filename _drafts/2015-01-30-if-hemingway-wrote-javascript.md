My dad got me [If Hemingway Wrote Javascript][1] by Angus Croll for
Christmas. I've basically devoured it.

  [1]: http://www.amazon.com/Hemingway-Wrote-JavaScript-Angus-Croll/dp/1593275854/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422475515&sr=8-1&keywords=if+hemingway+wrote+javascript

<!--break-->

The book is organized into several exercises given to a class of
beginning Javascript coders. I'll be writing my own solutions to the
various exercises in the book, in Javascript, but also in C, Python,
and Haskell.

I'll host the [project repository][2] on GitHub, and I might chime in
on my progress here on the blog sporadically.
