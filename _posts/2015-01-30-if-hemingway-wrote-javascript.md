My dad got me [If Hemingway Wrote Javascript][1] by Angus Croll for
Christmas. I've basically devoured it.

  [1]: http://www.amazon.com/Hemingway-Wrote-JavaScript-Angus-Croll/dp/1593275854/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422475515&sr=8-1&keywords=if+hemingway+wrote+javascript

<!--break-->

The book is organized into several exercises given to a class of
beginning Javascript coders (who all happen to be famous authors).
It's very entertaining, and I highly recommend it, even if you're
someone who, like me, has limited experience programming.

I'll be writing my own solutions to the various exercises in the
book, in Javascript, but also in C, Python, and Haskell. I'll host
the [project repository][2] on GitHub. So far, I've done Haskell
implementations of the first four exercises. and I might chime in on
my progress here on the blog sporadically.
