Welcome to my blog.
I'll use this blog to post musings about \\(math\\), maybe some games, maybe some `coding`.
**Oh!** The possibilities are _endless._

Well, let's not be over-dramatic.
I'm mostly making this website because I needed a new outlet since I shut down my [Auburn webspace](http://www.auburn.edu/~dpb0006) a while ago.

Having said that, I'm in the middle of the semester, so I won't have a lot of time to make blog posts.
So, with very infrequent updates planned, you might as well subscribe to the RSS feed.
It's not like I'm going to crowd your feed reader with tons of updates ^_^
