Welcome to my blog. I'll use this blog to post musings about math, maybe
some games, maybe some coding. **Oh!** The possibilities are _endless._

Well, let's not be over-dramatic. I'm mostly making this website because
my online presense has gone a little thin since I shut down my
[Auburn webspace](http://www.auburn.edu/~dpb0006) a while ago. I'm not
gunna lie---I'm mostly putting this site up because I needed something
to show up when potential employers google me. Hire me, by the way <.<

With that in the open, yeah, I'm in the middle of the application
cycle, so I won't have a lot of time to make blog. So, with very
infrequent updates planned, you might as well subscribe to the RSS feed.
It's not like I'm going to crowd your feed reader with tons of updates
^_^
