Welcome to my blog. I'll use this blog to post musings about math, maybe
some games, maybe some coding. **Oh!** The possibilities are _endless._

Well, let's not be over-dramatic. I'm mostly making this website because
I needed a new outlet since I shut down my
[Auburn webspace](http://www.auburn.edu/~dpb0006) a while ago.

Having said that, I'm in the middle of the semester,
so I won't have a lot of time to make blog. So, with very
infrequent updates planned, you might as well subscribe to the RSS feed.
It's not like I'm going to crowd your feed reader with tons of updates
^_^
