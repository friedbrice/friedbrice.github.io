Posting this before I forget. It's a set of adaptations to the rules of
[Settlers of Catan](http://www.catan.com) to accommodate two-players.

<!--break-->

Settlers is a table-top strategy games akin to [4X][wiki4x]
video games. Three or four players race to colonize a continent while
gaining relative advantage over one another.

The dynamic nature of the game, and the necessity of trading resources
with other players, causes the typical strategies to break down with
only two players. A quick Google search will reveal a handful of
two-player variants, but my friend and I eventually _settled_ (ahaha!)
on [this one][baum], making a few of our own modifications along the way.

I'll summarize the rules changes for you:

* Players roll two (differently colored) pairs of dice. One color is
  designated as always being resolved first. Both pairs are resolved in
  order, and the _rolling player_ moves the robber if a seven is
  rolled.

* Discard half your hand (rounded down) if you have _ten_ or more cards
  in hand (instead of the usual eight).

* No trades between players (why would you trade with your single mortal
  enemy?)

* Game ends when one player reaches 12 points _or_ when one player's
  score exceeds the other player's score by six or more points
  (one-sided games are no fun to play through to the end, especially
  since it becomes very hard to catch up in a two-player game).

With these rules, the robber (or rather, chasing away the robber)
becomes very important. This is a perfectly fine way to play, if you
don't mind spending all of your available resources on development
cards. But sometimes, even with both players pursuing an arms race of
knight cards, an very unequal distribution of sevens can make the game
an exercise in not gouging your own eyes out.

In order to correct for this, [baumfamily][baum] suggests that the
player with the lower score move the robber whenever a seven is rolled.
But my friend and I are _way_ too cutthroat for a rule like that to fly!
So we make a final rule change:

* The robber returns to the desert two rolls (_ie,_ four total dice
  resolutions) after being placed.

With this final rule, the robber is still very annoying, but collecting
knights is not nearly as critical. Which is good, since they already
give you the Largest Army bonus. Under these rules, you can pursue a
strategy of [ninjaing][] that bonus (just like in the standard three/four
player game) instead of the bonus just giving two extra points to
whichever player is already coming out on top.

We've played a few games under these rules. They're short, fast-paced,
and fun.
