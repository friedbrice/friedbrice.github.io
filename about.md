I'm a software engineer with [CJ Affiliate][1]. We do online advertising, but we do it the right way. Instead of automated cookie scrutiny belching out formulaic, irrelevant ads, we build tools that allow _publishers_ (_e.g.,_ your favorite blogs) to connect directly with _advertisers_ (_e.g.,_ the stores you shop at) so that the publishers can hand-pick the most relevant ads for their audiences. This kind of advertising is called _affiliate._

I finished my PhD in Mathematics (specifically, [Algebra][2] and [Lie Theory][3]) at [Auburn University][4] under Huajun Huang in June 2014. I still find time to do [research][rp] on occasion.

I grew up in [Rialto, California][5] and did my undergrad at [Cal State Channel Islands][6] in [Camarillo][7]. I currently live in beautiful [Santa Barbara][8] and can often be found at the [Santa Monica Haskell Users Group][9] and at [Papers We Love, LA][10].

My hobbies include tabletop and video games, Linux, coding, urban design and transportation, and guitar. I'm also an Eagle Scout.
