I'm a Lecturer of Mathematics at [Cal State Bakersfield][1]. I finished
my PhD in [Algebra][2] and [Lie Theory][3] at [Auburn University][4]
under Huajun Huang in June 2014. I grew up in [Rialto, California][5],
and did my undergrad at [Cal State Channel Islands][6] in
[Camarillo][7].

In addition to [teaching][tp] and [researching][rp] mathematics, my
hobbies include tabletop and video games, Linux, smatterings of coding,
urban design and transportation, and guitar. I'm also an Eagle Scout.
