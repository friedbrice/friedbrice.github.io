I'm a Lecturer of Mathematics at [Cal State Bakersfield][1]. I finished
my PhD in [Algebra][2] and [Lie Theory][3] at [Auburn University][4]
under Huajun Huang in June 2014. I grew up in Rialto, California, and
did my undergrad at [Cal State Channel Islands][5].

In addition to [teaching][tp] and [researching][rp] mathematics, my
hobbies include tabletop and video games, Linux, smatterings of coding,
urban design and transportation, and guitar. I'm also an Eagle Scout.
