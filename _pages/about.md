I'm a senior software engineer at [Lumi][1]. Lumi is a marketplace that provides supply-chain-as-a-service to your favorite brands. We empower brands to make informed choices about their supply chain to help create a more sustainable future.

I finished my PhD in Mathematics (specifically, [Algebra][2] and [Lie Theory][3]) at [Auburn University][4] under Huajun Huang in June 2014. I still find time to do [research][rp] on occasion.

I grew up in [Rialto, California][5] and did my undergrad at [Cal State Channel Islands][6] in [Camarillo][7]. I currently live in beautiful [Ventura][8] and can often be found at the [Santa Monica Haskell Users Group][9] and at [Papers We Love, LA][10].

My hobbies include tabletop and video games, Linux, coding, urban design and transportation, and guitar. I'm also an Eagle Scout.
