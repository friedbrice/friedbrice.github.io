I'm a software engineer and mathematician. Formerly, I wrote Haskell and Purescript at [Lumi][1], a supply-chain-as-a-service company based in Los Angeles, CA. Before that, I used Scala for machine learning and GraphQL API servers at [CJ Affiliate][cj], an online marketing company based in Santa Barbara, CA. I'm also a part-time Mathematics Lecturer at [Cal State Channel Islands][ci], where I teach _Business Calculus_ and _Strategies and Game Design_.

I finished my PhD in Mathematics (specifically, [Algebra][2] and [Lie Theory][3]) at [Auburn University][4] under Huajun Huang in June 2014. I still find time to do [research][rp] on occasion.

I grew up in [Rialto, California][5] and did my undergrad at [Cal State Channel Islands][ci] in [Camarillo][7]. I currently live in beautiful [Ventura][8] and can often be found at the [Santa Monica Haskell Users Group][9] and at [Papers We Love, LA][10].

My hobbies include tabletop and video games, Linux, coding, urban design and transportation, and guitar. I'm also an Eagle Scout.
