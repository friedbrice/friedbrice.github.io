I'm a software engineer and mathematician. Formerly, I wrote Haskell and Typescript at [Mercury][mercury], a banking services provider in San Francisco. Before that, I wrote Haskell and Purescript at [Lumi][lumi], a supply-chain services provider in Los Angeles, and wrote Scala for machine learning and GraphQL API servers at [CJ Affiliate][cj], an online marketing company in Santa Barbara. I've also been a part-time Computer Science and Mathematics Lecturer at [Cal State Channel Islands][ci] in [Camarillo][camarillo], where I taught the various calculuses, _Strategies and Game Design_, _History of Math_, and _Introduction to Algorithms_. You can read all about this on my [resume][resume].

I finished my PhD in Mathematics (specifically, [Algebra][algebra] and [Lie Theory][lie-theory]) at [Auburn University][auburn] under Huajun Huang in June 2014. I still dream about finding time to do [research][research].

I grew up in [Rialto, California][rialto] and did my undergrad at Cal State Channel Islands. I currently split my time between the breathtakingly-beautiful city of [San Buenaventura][ventura] and the incomparably-exhilarating city of San Francisco.

I spend a lot of my free time Swing dancing ([Lindy Hop][lindy], specifically). When I'm in So Cal, I'm a regular at Ventura's _Juke Joint_ and at Pasadena's _LindyGroove_ and _PBDA Swing Out Saturday_ dances. In the Bay, you'll find me dancing at _Cat's Corner_ and _The Woodchopper's Ball_ dances, as well as at Decodance and Local Edition. When I'm able, I'll also try to make it to Monday's dance at the Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo and to Tuesday's and Friday's dances at Irvine's Atomic Ballroom.

My other hobbies include going on long walks, tabletop and video games, recreational coding, starting blog posts that I'll never finish writing, bookmarking other people's blog posts that I'll never finish reading, and playing guitar. In the before-times, I frequented the [Santa Monica Haskell Users Group][smhug] and [Papers We Love, LA][papers-la]. I hope to someday check out San Francisco's legendary Meetup scene, if that's ever a thing again.
