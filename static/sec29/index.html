<h1 id="section-2.9---inverse-functions-continued">Section 2.9 - Inverse Functions (continued)</h1>
<p>Online lecture notes making up for missed day on Friday, Mar 27.</p>
<p>Get out a sheet of paper and a pencil, because I will be asking you to draw some graphs (trust me, it'll be both easy and illuminating).</p>
<h2 id="definition-inverse-functions">Definition: Inverse functions</h2>
<p>Two functions <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g\)</span> are <em>inverse</em> functions of each other if both statement <span class="math">\[(f \circ g)(x) = x\]</span> and <span class="math">\[(g \circ f)(x) = x\]</span> are true.</p>
<p>If one of the statements is true but the other fails, then <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g\)</span> are called <em>partial inverses</em> of each other.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p><span class="math">\(f(x) = \frac{x-4}{3} + 1\)</span>. Find <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(x)\)</span>.</p>
<div style="color: #000099;">
<h3>Computational Approach</h3>
<p>We begin by writing the computational steps taken to evaluate <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, and then write down the opposite operations in the reverse order for <span class="math">\(f^{-1}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(f:\)</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>subtract 4</li>
<li>divide by 3</li>
<li>add 1</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math">\(f^{-1}:\)</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>subtract 1</li>
<li>multiply by 3</li>
<li>add 4</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math">\[f^{-1}(x) = 3(x-1) + 4 = 3x + 1\]</span></p>
<h3>Algebraic Approach</h3>
<p>We write out <span class="math">\(f\)</span> as an equation <span class="math">\(y = f(x)\)</span>, then we reverse the roles of the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> variables to get an equation for <span class="math">\(f^{-1}\)</span> and solve that equation for <span class="math">\(y\)</span> to get the formula for <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(x)\)</span>.</p>
<span class="math">\[\begin{align*}
f &amp;: y = \frac{x-4}{3} + 1 \\
f^{-1} &amp;: x = \frac{y-4}{3} + 1 \\
&amp; x - 1 = \frac{y-4}{3} \\
&amp; 3(x-1) = y - 4 \\
&amp; 3(x-1) + 4 = y
\end{align*}\]</span> <span class="math">\[f^{-1}(x) = 3(x-1) + 4 = 3x + 1\]</span>
</div>
<h2 id="graphs-of-inverse-functions">Graphs of Inverse Functions</h2>
<p>Notice how in the algebraic approach to the above example we swap the role of the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> variables in order to find the inverse function. This has a graphical interpretation: swap the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> coordinates of points in order to graph the inverse function.</p>
<p>In other words, if, say <span class="math">\((2,7)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((5,-3)\)</span> are points on the graph of <span class="math">\(y = f(x)\)</span>, then <span class="math">\((7,2)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((-3,5)\)</span> will be points on the graph of <span class="math">\(y = f^{-1}(x).\)</span></p>
<h2 id="example-1">Example</h2>
<p><span class="math">\(f(x) = \frac{x^3}{10} + x\)</span>. Graph <span class="math">\(y = f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y = f^{-1}(x)\)</span> on the same coordinate plane.</p>
<div style="color: #000099;">
<p>We make a table of points in order to graph <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> <span class="math">\[\begin{array}{c | c}
x &amp; f(x) \\
\hline
-3 &amp; -5.7 \\
-2 &amp; -2.8 \\
-1 &amp; -1.1 \\
0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1.1 \\
2 &amp; 2.8 \\
3 &amp; 5.7
\end{array}\]</span> Now draw the graph.</p>
In order to graph <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(x)\)</span>, we swap the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> coordinates on our table. A table for <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(x)\)</span> then looks like: <span class="math">\[\begin{array}{c | c}
x &amp; f^{-1}(x) \\
\hline
-5.7 &amp; -3 \\
-2.8 &amp; -2 \\
-1.1 &amp; -1 \\
0 &amp; 0 \\
1.1 &amp; 1 \\
2.8 &amp; 2 \\
5.7 &amp; 3
\end{array}\]</span> Now draw the graph of <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(x)\)</span> on the same coordinate plane.
</div>
<h2 id="the-graph-of-f-1x-is-a-reflection-of-the-graph-of-fx">The Graph of <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(x)\)</span> is a reflection of the graph of <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span></h2>
<p>Do the example above: you will see an interesting pattern.</p>
<p>You should have seen that the graph of <span class="math">\(f^{1}(x)\)</span> is the reflection of the graph of <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> across the line <span class="math">\(y = x\)</span> (line with slope <span class="math">\(1\)</span> passing through <span class="math">\((0,0)\)</span>, draw it).</p>
<p>This is always true: to find the graph of <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(x)\)</span>, take the graph of <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> and reflect it across the line <span class="math">\(y = x\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="example-2">Example</h2>
<p>Say <span class="math">\(f(x) = x^2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g(x) = \sqrt{x}\)</span>. Show why <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g\)</span> are partial inverses, but they are not full inverses.</p>
<div style="color: #000099;">
<p>To check to see if two functions are inverses, compose them.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[(f \circ g)(x) = (\sqrt{x})^2 = x.\]</span> Composition in this directions gives <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, as desired.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[(g \circ f)(x) = \sqrt{x^2} = |x|.\]</span> Composition in this direction doesn't give <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, it gives <span class="math">\(|x|\)</span>.</p>
Because one direction fails to give <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, the functions are not inverses, they are only partial inverses.
</div>
<h2 id="graphical-explanation-of-partial-inverses">Graphical Explanation of Partial Inverses</h2>
<p>We can see why <span class="math">\(f(x) = x^2\)</span> fails to have a full inverse by examining the graph.</p>
<p>We graph <span class="math">\(f(x) = x^2\)</span>. Here's a table to get you started. <span class="math">\[\begin{array}{c | c}
x &amp; y \\
\hline
-2 &amp; 4 \\
-1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 \\
2 &amp; 4
\end{array}\]</span> Now go ahead and graph that.</p>
<p>What happens if we swap all the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> coordinates in order to draw the graph of the inverse? We get <span class="math">\[\begin{array}{c | c}
x &amp; y \\
\hline
4 &amp; -2 \\
1 &amp; -1 \\
0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 \\
4 &amp; 2
\end{array}\]</span> Now graph that on a separate coordinate plane.</p>
<p>Is that graph even a function? Does it pass the vertical line test?</p>
<p>Since the resulting graph is not a function, we can't successfully create a full inverse for <span class="math">\(f(x) = x^2\)</span>. The best we can do is create a partial inverse, which is what the graph of <span class="math">\(\sqrt{x}\)</span> is.</p>
<p>Here's a table for <span class="math">\(y = \sqrt{x}\)</span>. <span class="math">\[\begin{array}{c | c}
x &amp; \sqrt{x} \\
\hline
0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 \\
4 &amp; 2
\end{array}\]</span> Graph that sucker. You'll see that it's basically half of the graph of what we got when we flipped <span class="math">\(y = x^2\)</span>, in a way that makes the result a function.</p>
<p>So you see, <span class="math">\(\sqrt{x}\)</span> is an inverse for about half of <span class="math">\(x^2\)</span>, so that's why we call it a partial inverse.</p>
<h2 id="horizontal-line-test">Horizontal Line Test</h2>
<p>The above discussion suggests to us a way where we can determine whether a function has a full inverse or a partial inverse just by looking at the graph: we call this method the <em>horizontal line test</em></p>
<p>Take a function <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> and look at its graph. If you can draw a horizontal line (remember, &quot;horizontal&quot; as in &quot;the horizon&quot;) that hits your graph in more than one place, then <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> will fail to have a full inverse.</p>
<p>For example, the graph of <span class="math">\(f(x) = x^2\)</span> does not pass the horizontal line test, so we can tell that <span class="math">\(x^2\)</span> won't have a full inverse.</p>
<p>Any graph that does pass the horizontal line test will have a full inverse. We call graphs that pass the horizontal line test <em>one-to-one</em> functions.</p>
<h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>
<p><em>Four very important concepts in this course are lines and slope, piecewise functions, graphs, and inverse functions. The exercise below combines all four of those concepts.</em></p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\[f(x) =
\begin{cases}
\frac{x-4}{3} &amp; \text{if } x \leq 1 \\
2x - 3 &amp; \text{if } x &gt; 1
\end{cases}\]</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Graph <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> on a coordinate plane.</li>
<li>Draw the graph of <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(x)\)</span> on the same coordinate plane by exchanging <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> coordinates of each point.</li>
<li>From the graph, we see that <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(x)\)</span> is a piecewise function consisting of two pieces that are lines. Write out the piecewise formula for <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(x)\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, complete the online homework for Section 2.9 on <code>MyMathLab</code> and the paper-pencil homework for Section 2.9 on <code>blackboard</code>.</p>
<p>As always, attempt the homework problems and come to office hours with questions when you get stuck.</p>
