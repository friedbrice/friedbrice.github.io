My research interests include [Lie algebras][] and [representation theory][],
[linear algebra][] and [matrix][] theory, and related topics. Specifically,
I've done studied derivations of Lie algebras and zero product determined
algebras.

<h2 id="derivations">Derivations of parabolic Lie algebras</h2>

A _derivation_ on a Lie algebra \\( L \\) is a map \\( f: L \to L \\) satisfying

\\[
  f\big([x,y]\big) = \big[f(x), y\big] + \big[x, f(y)\big]
\\]

for all \\( x, y \in L \\).

Huajun Huang and I proved that _blah blah blah_ ([article](#brice0000derivations)).

That's enough for now.

<h2 id="zpd">Zero product determined algebras</h2>

An algebra \\( A \\) is _zero product determined_ if for each bilinear map
\\( \varphi: A \times A \to V \\) satisfying

\\[
  \varphi(x, y) = 0 \text{ whenever } xy=0
\\]

there is a linear map \\( f: A^2 \to A \\) such that

\\[
  \varphi(x, y) = f(xy)
\\]

for all \\( x, y \in A \\).

Huajun Huang and I proved that _blah blah blah_ ([article](#brice2015zero))
and that _blah blah blah_ ([article](#brice0000note)).

That's enough for now.
